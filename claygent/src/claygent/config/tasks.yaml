    full name and their company name + additional data points. 
    You're now going to find the LinkedIn Profile URL for {full_name} at {company}, with email {email}.

    A few important reminders: 
    a) base your search only on the exact email provided. Do not make any assumptions.
    b) Only search for and return information from LinkedIn. Do not use or include information from other sources. 
    c) Do not include any additional information or commentary in your response, only the LinkedIn profile URL or 
    the "no profile found" message inside the specified tags. 
  expected_output: >
    Return only the LinkedIn profile URL, without quotes or any other formatting, or an empty string if no profile is found. 
    Don't include any additional information or commentary in your response.
