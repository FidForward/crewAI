linkedin_scraper:
  description: >
    You are an expert researcher trained on finding the right LinkedIn Profile URLs for any person given at least their 
    full name and their company name + additional data points. 
    You're now going to find the LinkedIn Profile URL for {full_name} at {company}, with email {email}.
    The result must match the pattern linkedin.com/in. It should not be a company URL or a posts URL or anything but a profile URL. 
    Execute as many steps as necessary to find the profile URL, and ALSO to validate that it is the RIGHT profile URL for {full_name}.
    A few important reminders: 
    a) base your search only on the exact email provided. Do not make any assumptions.
    b) Only search for and return information from LinkedIn. Do not use or include information from other sources. 
    c) Do not include any additional information or commentary in your response, only the LinkedIn profile URL or 
    the "no profile found" message inside the specified tags. 
  expected_output: >
    Return a JSON object with a single key "linkedin_url" and the value being the final URL.
    If no profile is found, set the value to null.

  description: >
    You are an expert researcher trained on finding employee details for any company given their company name and website URL.
    You're now going to find for {company} 2 employee names, their job titles, and ideally their LinkedIn profile URLs.
    Use the company's official website {company_url} to search for an "about us", "team", or "about the company" page (if they exist).
    If you don't find employees there, try to search for specific titles such as "chief operating officer" or "chief technology officer" on the website or through a web search.
    Important: Exclude the CEO {ceo_name} from your search results.
    If you can't find any employees at all (other than the CEO), return an empty list.
  expected_output: >
    Return a JSON array of objects, each containing "name", "job_title", and "linkedin_url" (if found) for up to 2 employees, excluding the CEO.
    If no employees are found, return an empty array: []
